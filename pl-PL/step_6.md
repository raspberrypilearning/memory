\--- task \--- Add two new variables called `high score`{:class="block3variables"} and `name`{:class="block3variables"} to your project. \--- /task \---

When the game ends because the player gets the sequence wrong, the game should check whether the score is higher than the current high score. If it is, the game should save the score as the high score, and also store the name of the player.

\--- task \--- Add code to your character sprite to store the `high score`{:class="block3variables"}. Also ask for the player's name, and store it in the `name`{:class="block3variables"} variable.

[[[generic-scratch3-high-score]]]

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- Your new code needs to follow this pattern:

After the `Game over`{:class="block3looks"} message `If`{:class="block3control"} the `score`{:class="block3variables"} is `greater than`{:class="block3operators"} the `high score`{:class="block3variables"} `Set`{:class="block3variables"} the `high score`{:class="block3variables"} to the `score`{:class="block3variables"} `Ask`{:class="block3sensing"} for the player's name `Set`{:class="block3variables"} the `name`{:class="block3variables"} to the `answer`{:class="block3sensing"} \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

ask [What's your name?] and wait

set [high score v] to [ ] 

set [name v] to [ ] 
```

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's how your code for when the red button is pressed should look:

![balerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
when I receive [red v]
if <(item (1 v) of [sequence v])=[1]> then
    play drum (item (1 v) of [sequence v]) for (0.25) beats
    delete (1 v) of [sequence v]
else
    say [Game over!] for (1) seconds
    if < (score :: variables) > (high score) > then
        set [high score v] to (score :: variables)
        ask [High score! Jak masz na imię?] I czekać
        ustawić [imię v] na (odpowiedź)
    koniec
    zatrzymać [wszystkie v]
koniec
```

You need to add this new code to the character sprite for the other three colours too!

Can you see that the 'Game over' code for each of the four colours is exactly the same?

![balerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
say [Game over!] for (1) seconds
if < (score :: variables) > (high score) > then
    set [high score v] to (score :: variables)
    ask [High score! What is your name?] and wait
    set [name v] to (answer)
end
stop [all v]
```

If you need to change any of the 'Game over' code, for example to add a sound or change the 'Game over' message, you have to change it four times. That's annoying and wastes a lot of time.

Zamiast tego możesz zdefiniować własny blok kodu i używać go w dowolnym miejscu projektu.

\--- task \--- Click on `My blocks`{:class="block3myblocks"}, and then on **Make a Block**. Call this new block `Game over`{:class="block3myblocks"}.

\--- /task \---

\--- task \--- Add the code from the `else`{:class="block3control"} block connected to the `red`{:class="block3events"} broadcast to the `Game over`{:class="block3myblocks"} block so that it looks like this:

![balerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
define Game over
say [Game over!] for (1) seconds
if < (score :: variables) > (high score) > then
    set [high score v] to (score :: variables)
    ask [High score! What is your name?] and wait
    set [name v] to (answer)
end
stop [all v]
```

\--- /task \---

\--- task \--- Now remove the code that's in the `else`{:class="block3control"} block connected to the `red`{:class="block3events"} broadcast, and add in the `Game over`{:class="block3myblocks"} block instead:

![balerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
when I receive [red v]
if <(item (1 v) of [sequence v])=[1]> then
    play drum (\(1\) Snare Drum v) for (0.25) beats
    delete (1 v) of [sequence v]
else
    Game over :: custom
end
```

\--- /task \---

\--- task \--- Test your new block by playing the game and clicking the red button at the wrong point in the colour sequence. \--- /task \---

Your new `Game over`{:class="block3myblocks"} block is a **function**, a little script that you can use anywhere you like in your code by adding the `Game over`{:class="block3myblocks"} block in.

\--- task \--- Also replace the code in the `else`{:class="block3control"} block connected to the `broadcasts`{:class="block3events"} for the other colours with your new `Game over`{:class="block3myblocks"} block. Oto jak powinien wyglądać kod `niebieski`{:class="block3events"}

![balerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
when I receive [blue v]
if <(item (1 v) of [sequence v])=[1]> then
    play drum (\(2\) Bass Drum v) for (0.25) beats
    delete (1 v) of [sequence v]
else
    Game over :: custom
end
```

\--- /task \---

\--- task \--- Now add a sound that plays when the wrong button is pressed. You only need to add this code once in the `Game over`{:class="block3myblocks"} block that you made, and not four separate times!

![balerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
define Game over
start sound [Cough1 v]
say [Game over!] for (1) seconds
if < (score :: variables) > (high score) > then
    play sound (trumpet1 v)
    set [high score v] to (score)
    ask [High score! What is your name?] and wait
    set [name v] to (answer)
end
stop [all v]
```
