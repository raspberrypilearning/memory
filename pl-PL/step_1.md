## Introduction

In this project, you will create a memory game in which you have to memorise and repeat a random sequence of colours!

### What you will make

Click on the green flag to start. Watch the sequence of colours shown by the dancer's dress and listen to the accompanying drum beats, then repeat them back to her. If you get the order wrong, it's game over!
