## වර්ණ(colour) අනුක්‍රමයක්(sequence එකක්) සෑදීම

පළමුව අහඹු(random) ලෙස වර්ණ(colour) අනුක්‍රමයක්(sequence එකක්) පෙන්විය හැකි චරිතයක්(character එකක්) සාදන්න.

\--- task \--- නව Scratch ව්යාපෘතියක්(project එකක්) විවෘත්ත කරන්න.

**අන්තර්ජාල මාර්ගගත(Online):** [rpf.io/scratch-new](https://rpf.io/scratchon) හි අන්තර්ජාල මාර්ගගතව නව Scratch ව්‍යාපෘතියක් විවෘත කරන්න.

**Offline**: open a new project in the offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](https://rpf.io/scratchoff).

\--- /task \---

\--- task \--- Choose a character sprite and a backdrop. You could use the ballerina, but your character doesn't have to be a person, they only need to be able to show different colours.

![තිර රුව(screenshot)](images/colour-sprite.png) \--- /task \---

+ Your game should use a different number to represent each colour:
    
    + 1 = red
    + 2 = blue
    + 3 = green
    + 4 = yellow

\--- task \--- Give your character four costumes that have different colours, one costumes for each of the four colours shown above. Make sure that your coloured costumes are in the same order as the list above.

![තිර රුව(screenshot)](images/colour-costume.png) \--- /task \---

If you want, you can use the **color a shape** tool to fill parts of the costume with a different colour.

![color-a-shape](images/color-a-shape.png)

Next, add a list for storing the random sequence of colours that the player has to remember.

\--- task \--- Create a list called `sequence`{:class="block3variables"}. Only the character sprite needs to see this list, so you can select **For this sprite only** when you create the list.

[[[generic-scratch3-make-list]]]

\--- /task \---

You should now see lots of new code blocks for using lists. The empty list should be visible in the top left-hand corner of the Stage.

![තිර රුව(screenshot)](images/colour-list-blocks-annotated.png)

Each colour has a different number, so you can choose a random colour by randomly choosing a number and adding it to the list.

\--- task \--- Add this code to the character sprite to choose a random number and add it to `sequence`{:class="block3variables"}:

![ballerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
add (pick random (1) to (4)) to [sequence v]
```

\--- /task \---

\--- task \--- Test your code. Check that, each time you click the flag, a random number between 1 and 4 gets added to the list. \--- /task \---

\--- task \--- Can you add code to your program to generate five random numbers at once?

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- Add a `delete all of sequence`{:class="block3variables"} to first delete all the items on the list, and then add a `repeat`{:class="block3control"} block that adds five random numbers to the list. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

ඔබගේ කේතය(code එක) මෙබඳු එකක් විය යුතුයි:

![ballerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
delete (all v) of [sequence v]
repeat (5)
    add (pick random (1) to (4)) to [sequence v]
end
```

\--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \--- \--- /task \---

\--- task \--- Each time a number gets added to the list, the character should change its costume so the costume's colour matches the number. Put these blocks into your code immediately below where a random number is added to `sequence`{:class="block3variables"}:

![ballerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
switch costume to (item (length of [sequence v]) of [sequence v])
wait (1) seconds
```
