## Challenge: adding sound

Test your project a few times. You may notice that sometimes the same number is chosen twice (or more) in a row, making the sequence harder to memorise. Can you make a drum sound play each time the character changes costume?

Can you make a different drum sound play depending on the random number chosen? This will be _very_ similar to your code to change the character's costume.
