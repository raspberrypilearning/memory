## Challenge: Another costume
Have you noticed that your game starts with your character showing one of the 4 colours, and that they always display the last colour in the sequence while the player is repeating the sequence?

Can you add another plain white costume to your character, which is displayed at the start of your game, and when the player is trying to copy the sequence?
