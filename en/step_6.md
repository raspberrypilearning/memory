## Challenge: Creating 4 buttons
Repeat the steps above for your blue, green and yellow buttons. Which code will stay the same, and which code will change for each button?

You can also add sounds for when the buttons are pressed.

Remember to test the code you've added! Can you memorise a sequence of 5 colours? Is the sequence different each time?
